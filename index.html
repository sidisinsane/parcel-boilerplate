        <p>Marty, are you alright? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. What, I don't get what happened. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.</p>

        <p>Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy. What? He's a very strange young man. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?</p>

        <p>Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Science Fiction Theater. Where were we. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow. Yeah, it's 8:00.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Well, I figured, what the hell. Yeah, gimme a Tab. When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.</p>

        <p>Right, I got it. Wrecked? He's alright. No. Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?</p>

        <p>Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Where? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.</p>

        <p>you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Wow, you must be rich. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Jennifer. I'm gonna ram him.</p>

        <p>Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Lorraine. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Why do you keep following me around?</p>

        <p>No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- I think we need a rematch. How about a ride, Mister? Oh. Uncle Jailbird Joey?</p>

        <p>Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Marty. Marty. Marty. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?</p>

I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life? Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?</p>

        <p>Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Let's get him. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this. Aw yeah, everything is great. Will you take care of that?</p>

        <p>Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. That's for messing up my hair. Okay. Quiet.</p>

        <p>Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. What, what, ma? Nothing's coming to my mind. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Sit here, Marty.</p>
